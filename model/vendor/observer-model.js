// Gratheon Entrance Observer — parametric model of the Phase 3 production kit.
// Single source of truth for the browser viewer (index.html) and the GLB
// exporter (export-glb.mjs). All dimensions are in millimetres; the scene is
// built in metres (glTF convention).
//
// Axes match robotic-beehive/model/hive-model.js and
// beehive-sensors/model/scale-model.js:
//   X = left/right, Y = up, Z = front(+)/back(-), entrance at +Z.
//
// The Observer is built in its own frame and then placed on a hive, on the
// beehive scale or on the Robotic Beehive. Its origin is the middle of the
// entrance floor on the front face of the hive; +Z points away from the hive.
//
// Layout rules:
// - A flat wall frame shaped like a house gable (entrance plate, two slim
//   uprights, two rafters) stays on the hive. It carries the porch with the
//   automatic gate and the landing board.
// - The head hangs on the apex of the frame: a ridge beam, a steep gable roof
//   running from the hive wall forward, and one small metal pod under the
//   ridge with the camera and the computer. Nothing but the pod is machined.
// - The ridge runs front to back, so rain and snow slide off the sides and
//   drip beside the landing board, never onto it.
// - A short porch moves the doorway onto the board, so every bee in or out
//   crosses the porch mouth in view, even if it landed on the hive wall. The
//   mouth is the counting line and holds the gate.
// - The camera looks down at the board, tilted toward the hive to also see the
//   porch and the bottom of the wall. Frame, roof and cables are outside the view.
// - Every cable enters from below, under the right upright, and runs inside it.

export const PARTS = {
  frame: ['Wall frame', 'One laser-cut sheet of 2 mm 5052 marine-grade aluminium, folded on a press brake and powder-coated graphite: aluminium does not rust, and all fasteners are A2 stainless. The face lies against the hive; folded 15 mm returns along its outer edge and around the big window turn the uprights into U-channels (open to the front, closed by the aluminium covers) and stiffen the gable. Cut-outs: the big window over the hive front, the entrance window, and four vertical slots for the wood screws. It stays on the hive and carries the porch and the landing board; the head hangs on the pocket at its apex. No welds, no joints.'],
  plate: ['Entrance plate', 'The bottom of the wall frame, with a window matching the 300 × 15 mm entrance and four vertical slots (5 × 11 mm) beside it for the wood screws. Matt graphite powder coat, like the rest of the frame: no glare in the camera view.'],
  riser: ['Scale risers', 'On the beehive scale the wall frame stands on two printed ASA risers hooked onto the scale front rail, 2 mm clear of the hive. Frame, roof, snow and bees on the board are then carried by the scale base and never weighed.'],
  robotFront: ['Robot entrance frame', 'On the Robotic Beehive the wall frame is bolted to the cabinet front, where the entrance tunnel ends. Power and data come from the robot PoE switch inside a corner post.'],
  screws: ['Wood screws', 'Four 4.5 × 40 mm A2 stainless countersunk wood screws (Torx T20), two each side of the entrance, through the slots in the entrance plate into the front of the bottom board. The slots allow ±3 mm to level the frame. Nothing is screwed into the hive bodies, so they still lift off; the top of the frame only leans on them through two rubber pads.'],
  porchScrews: ['Porch screws', 'Four M4 × 10 A2 stainless button screws through the tabs on the porch sides into rivet nuts pressed into the entrance plate. Undo them to take the porch and gate off for cleaning at the end of the season.'],
  studs: ['Brick decks', 'Two small decks on the front corners of the landing board with a 4 × 4 grid of 8 mm studs, compatible with common toy construction bricks, in the hive colour. Owners can add their own figures and decorations. They are outside the camera view and to the side of the flight path.'],
  covers: ['Upright covers', 'Folded aluminium covers in the same graphite powder coat as the frame. They close the upright channels; the right one hides the cables. They clip in without screws.'],
  clips: ['Wall clips (top fixing)', 'Two small folded aluminium clips, each screwed to the first hive body with two 4 × 25 mm A2 stainless screws, hold the outer edges of the uprights against the wall at the top. The frame itself is never screwed to the body: to lift the first body, lift off the head, and the clips slide up off the uprights with the body.'],
  seal: ['Wall seal', 'EPDM foam strip behind the top edges of the frame, pressed against the hive wall, so rain running down the wall cannot get behind the frame.'],
  flashing: ['Roof flashing', 'The back edge of the roof is turned up 16 mm with an EPDM strip pressed against the hive wall, like the flashing where a porch roof meets a house. Rain running down the wall lands on the roof and runs off at the eaves, never behind the roof or onto the pod.'],
  border: ['Hive colour border', 'The wooden landing board is painted in the hive colour around the grey insert (sides and front) and on its front lip, with dots, stripes or chevrons in a contrasting colour. Bee-safe water-based paint. Beekeepers already paint hive fronts in different colours so bees find their own hive and drift less between hives. Bees see blue, yellow and white well and red as black, so the colours are blue, yellow, white and graphite. It is outside the camera view.'],
  antenna: ['Wi-Fi antennas', 'Two flat dual-band (2.4 / 5 GHz) antennas on the back of the wooden front gable, either side of the pod and tilted apart for polarisation diversity, on short U.FL cables into the pod. Wood and polycarbonate let radio through; the metal pod and the aluminium solar roof would not.'],
  channel: ['Cable upright', 'The right upright is a closed box section. The PoE cable and the gate cable run up inside it to the apex and along the ridge beam to the pod: no cable is in the sun, in the rain or in front of the lens.'],
  gland: ['Cable entries', 'Under the foot of the right upright, facing the ground: the PoE cable gland and the accessory socket. Water runs off them, not into them, and the cable leaves with a drip loop.'],
  m12: ['Accessory port', 'M12 8-pin socket with the pinout of the beehive scale front connector: 5 V out, ground, 1-Wire, UART, wake and shield. One short lead to the scale powers the scale pod from the Observer and shares time and readings, so the scale needs no solar board and both upload through one link.'],
  thumb: ['Apex hook', 'The ridge beam ends in a hook that drops into a pocket at the apex of the wall frame, locked by one captive honey-yellow thumbscrew. The head lifts off in seconds and always lands in the same place, with the camera aimed the same way.'],
  beam: ['Ridge beam', 'Standard 30 × 36 mm aluminium extrusion from the apex forward, under the ridge. It carries the roof, the front rafters and the pod, and the cables run inside it.'],
  rafter: ['Front rafters', 'Two slim folded strips under the front edge of the roof, from the end of the ridge beam to the eaves. They carry snow on the front corners. They sit above the lens, outside the view.'],
  pod: ['Camera + compute pod', 'The only machined metal part: a 170 × 140 mm piece of finned aluminium extrusion, IP65, with printed end caps. It holds the camera, the compute sled and the supervisor, and it is the heatsink: the fins sit in the ventilated space under the roof. No fan to clog with dust or propolis.'],
  camera: ['Camera module', '8 MP (3840 × 2160) Sony STARVIS 2 sensor on its own MIPI CSI board with a locked-focus, low-distortion M12 lens, 90° wide. It sits 186 mm above the board, 135 mm out from the hive, tilted 16° back toward the hive: it sees nearly the whole board, the porch with the gate and the bottom of the hive wall, so bees that land on the wall are tracked from the moment they land. The camera and the board are both fixed to the wall frame, so the view is calibrated once at the factory with a printed target; in use, the software checks the straight edges of the porch lintel and board against that reference and raises an alert if the head was knocked. On the board that gives about 9.5 px per mm: a bee is about 125 px long and a varroa mite about 14 px. A global-shutter module can replace it without changing the pod.'],
  hood: ['Lens hood + window', 'Matt black cone with a flat AR-coated glass window at its tip, facing the ground. Rain cannot reach it, the sky never reflects in it and the roof keeps direct sun off it. A 0.3 W heater film clears dew on cold mornings.'],
  led: ['Light bars', 'Two short diffused LED bars beside the lens, with crossed polarisers on the LEDs and the lens to remove glints from shiny bees and wet pollen. They only flash in sync with the exposure at dusk or in deep shade, so they add less than 0.3 W on average.'],
  mic: ['Microphone', 'MEMS microphone behind a mesh under the pod. Entrance audio (drone flight, piping, hornets, fanning) is stored with the counts for audio + video models, and a hornet buzz is a second trigger for the gate.'],
  sensor: ['Light + climate sensor', 'Ambient light, temperature and humidity. The supervisor uses them to decide when bees can fly, which is when the computer has to run, and to narrow the gate on cold nights.'],
  supervisor: ['Supervisor board', 'Always-on ESP32-S3 board, the same carrier design as the beehive scale: PoE+ input, 12–24 V DC input, solar charger, fuel gauge, the gate motor driver and a load switch for the compute sled. It idles at about 0.1 W, only powers the computer when bees can fly, and moves the gate on its own when needed (cold night, lost power, expired hornet guard).'],
  compute: ['Compute cassette', 'Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB), Hailo-8 26 TOPS accelerator and 256 GB NVMe on one sled. It slides out of the front of the pod after a quarter-turn. The sled is the upgrade path: pod, camera, power and connectors stay the same, and a Jetson Orin NX or the next accelerator slides into the same bay when pose models need more compute.'],
  face: ['Service face', 'Honey-yellow front of the compute cassette, set into the front gable: activity display, status ring, setup button and a USB-C port under a flap for copying full-resolution research clips on site.'],
  display: ['Activity display', 'Cheap reflective 2-row segment LCD (about €3), readable in direct sun and needing no backlight: today’s bees in (↓) and out (↑), with bars for the gate position. The always-on supervisor drives it through an HT1621 chip at about 50 µA, updates it every minute and keeps the last numbers while the computer sleeps. The button pages through yesterday, net flow and alerts.'],
  gable: ['Gables', 'The roof is closed at both ends. At the back the wall frame sheet fills the triangle between the rafters. At the front a panel of oiled thermo-treated pine closes the roof above the pod: the pod face sits in it, vent slots under the ridge let warm air out, and the Wi-Fi antennas sit behind it, where wood lets the signal through.'],
  battery: ['Battery cassette', 'Solar version: four LiFePO4 32700 cells (12.8 V, 77 Wh) on a sled that slides out of the left side of the pod, charged from the roof panels. LiFePO4 tolerates summer heat better than Li-ion. In the PoE version this bay is empty or holds an LTE modem.'],
  blank: ['Side bay cover', 'Cover of the pod side bay. Behind it goes the battery cassette (solar version) or an LTE modem for apiaries without Wi-Fi or Ethernet.'],
  canopy: ['Roof', 'A 3 mm opal (light-diffusing), UV-stabilised polycarbonate sheet bent once along the ridge into a 30° gable, 448 × 212 mm, from the hive wall forward. At 30° rain and snow slide off, to the sides: the eaves overhang the landing board edges, so drips fall beside the board, outside the view. Opal keeps its shadow on the board soft. It rests on the rafters of the wall frame at the back, the ridge beam and the front rafters.'],
  solarCanopy: ['Solar roof', 'The same gable in white powder-coated aluminium sheet (recyclable, unlike composite panel) with a 7 W ETFE panel laminated on each slope (14 W). Whichever way the hive faces, one slope gets the morning or afternoon sun. Bees fly when the sun shines, so the panels produce the most when the Observer has the most to do.'],
  porch: ['Entrance porch', 'A 46 mm deep, 17 mm high tunnel across the full entrance, in the same matt grey as the board. It moves the doorway forward onto the landing board: a bee that lands on the hive wall has to walk down onto the porch roof and step off in front of the mouth, so every bee in or out crosses the porch mouth in view. The mouth is the counting line. Open to the air, with no glass to clean or fog up.'],
  gate: ['Automatic entrance gate', 'A 2 mm plate that rises out of a slit in the porch floor at the mouth, with a 70 mm notch in its centre. One travel gives four positions: open (flush with the floor), reduced (only the 70 × 17 mm centre open, against wind, cold and robbing), hornet guard (a 70 × 5.5 mm slot: bees pass, hornets and wasps cannot) and closed (moving the hive, spraying nearby). It rises slowly with a soft silicone edge and a current limit, and only when the camera sees no bee in the mouth, so it cannot crush bees. Hidden under the floor when open.'],
  gateDrive: ['Gate drive housing', 'Sealed box of folded aluminium sheet with a gasketed lid, under the porch floor, outside the camera view, 336 × 18 mm with a gearbox bulge in the middle. Drain holes in the bottom let water and debris that fall through the slit out. Its lead plugs into the foot of the right upright. Tick “See inside the gate” to look through it.'],
  gateMotor: ['Motor + worm', 'N20-size micro stepper with a brass worm on its shaft, meshing with the worm wheel at the foot of the lead screw. A worm drive is self-locking: the gate holds any position without power, and bees or hornets cannot push it. About 1 W for 5 s per move.'],
  gateScrew: ['Lead screw + nut', 'Vertical 2 mm-lead screw turned by the worm wheel; a brass nut on the gate turns its rotation into 34 mm of travel, about 7 mm/s. The camera and a motor current limit stop it if a bee is in the way.'],
  gateGuide: ['Guide rods', 'Two stainless rods at the ends of the housing, with bronze bushings on the gate, so the 312 mm plate rises level and does not jam in the slit.'],
  gateSensor: ['Home sensor', 'Hall sensor on the housing floor and a magnet on the gate: the drive finds the open position after every power-up and counts steps from there.'],
  gateSupercap: ['Fail-open supercapacitor', 'Driver board with a supercapacitor that stays charged. If power is lost, it has enough energy to drive the gate back to open: the gate fails open, never closed.'],
  lintel: ['Gate lintel', 'The raised front edge of the porch roof. The gate slides up into it, and it marks the counting line from above.'],
  board: ['Landing board', '15 mm thermo-treated pine (no chemicals, stable outdoors), hinged to the front of the porch floor at a 6° slope so rain drains off, with an aluminium stiffener underneath. A flush grey HDPE insert covers only the area the camera sees; the rest of the wood is painted in the hive colour.'],
  insert: ['Board insert', 'Flush 3 mm matt grey HDPE plate: the background of every frame. Neutral light grey, because white would overexpose in the sun and hide pale pollen loads. It slides out forward for washing off droppings, dead bees and propolis, and is the only plastic the camera sees.'],
  hinge: ['Board hinge', 'Stainless pins at the front of the porch floor. The board folds up flat for shipping and swings down if something hits it.'],
  harness: ['Internal harness', 'PoE, accessory and gate lines from the foot of the right upright, up inside it, over the rafter and along the ridge beam to the supervisor board in the pod.'],
  cable: ['Cables', 'One PoE cable (power and data, up to 100 m) from under the right upright, run along the ground. With the scale, one short M12 lead joins the Observer and the scale.'],
  fov: ['Camera field of view', 'What the camera sees: the bottom of the hive wall, the porch with the gate and the landing board, about 400 mm across. The frame, roof, pod and cables are all outside it.'],
  bee: ['Bees', 'Honey bees on the landing board, on the porch roof and on the hive wall. At 4K each worker is about 125 px long, big enough for pose keypoints, pollen loads and mites.'],
  hive: ['Hive', 'A standard hive: bottom board, bodies and lid. The only change is the wall frame screwed to the bottom board.'],
  stand: ['Hive stand', 'Any stand works: the Observer hangs on the hive entrance and does not touch the stand.'],
  scale: ['Beehive scale', 'Gratheon beehive scale, simplified. The Observer stands on its front rail with two risers, and one M12 lead powers the scale pod and carries its readings.'],
  scaleLink: ['Scale connector', 'M12 socket under the front rail of the beehive scale. The Observer lead plugs in here in place of the solar landing board.'],
  robot: ['Robotic Beehive', 'Ghost of the Robotic Beehive cabinet. Its entrance tunnel ends in the Observer porch, and the cable runs inside the cabinet to the robot PoE switch.'],
